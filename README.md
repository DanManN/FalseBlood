The purpose of this plugin is to simulate the feel of the TV series "TrueBlood" in minecraft. As of know this plugin adds vampires and the trueblood potion (Acrid Potion in game) to minecraft. //Eventually//, all the creatures - vampire, werewolf, werepanther, shifter, and fairy - will be implemented one at a time. Also, if you have any ideas of how to make this plugin better or how what abilities each creature should have then please post your suggestions below.

=== Becoming A Vampire: ===

* Have your blood (food bar) drained by a vampire and refilled with vampire blood.
* Go to "The End" with a clock, speed, regeneration, and strength potion of the same tier. Right-click on the clock.
* Use the /fb make command to toggle vampire status.

=== Un-becoming a Vampire: ===

* Dying instantly from wooden-stake (aka wooden sword/shovel/hoe/pickaxe/ax, torch/redstone-torch, fence, or stick)
* Use the /fb make command to toggle vampire status.

=== Advantage/DisAdvantages to Vampires: ===

=== Advantages: ===
   * have night-vision effect constantly
   * have water-breathing effect constantly
   * automatically heal (at cost of blood)
   * can run faster (at cost of blood)
   * are stronger in combat (at cost of blood)
   * suck blood using fist from...
     * players (2 levels per hit)
     * villagers (3 levels per hit but  20% food posion chance)
     * enderman (5 levels per hit but 20% food posion chance)
     * zombie (1 level per hit and 70% food posion chance)

   * can drink a bottle of false blood regenerating 4 blood levels (is called Acrid Potion in game. Brewable by dropping an ender-eye in a cauldron filled with water and right-clicking the cauldron with a glass bottle.)
   * can heal players and give them strength potion if the player is at full health (at a cost of blood)
   * can FLY at age 50! (at a cost of blood)
=== Disadvantages: ===
   * burn in daylight (including nausea and blindness depending on intensity)
   * are vulnerable to gold which means that
     * cannot pick up gold items (except a clock which is always in their inventory)
     * burn when touching gold either by hitting it with their first or standing on it
     * take damage when attacking a person in gold armor
     * take extra damaged when attacked by gold items. also gives them a weakness effect

   * have a 94% chance to die instantly from a wooden stake. Wearing armor decreases the chance depending on how full your set of armor is. with a full set of armor you have only a 6% chance of dieing instantly
   * can't eat normal food or drink normal potions.

=== How to use abilities ===

====== Super Speed: ====== 

While sprinting, you will automatically be faster. Every five years a vampire ages increases the its speed.

====== Super Strength: ====== 

Right click with your clock to switch to "kick nature's ass" mode and you will be stronger in combat.

====== Blood Sucking ======

Right click with your clock to switch to "feast" mode and then attack your pray .

====== Give Blood ======

Right Click a player with you fists to give them your blood which will either heal them or give them strength potion if they are at full health.

====== Flying ======

If you are over age 50 then simply toggle flight the same way you would in creative mode.

== Commands: ==

* /fb make [player] - toggles the player's vampire status or yours if player is left out. Requires the falseblood.make permission.
* /fb setage [player] [age] - sets a vampires age or yours if player is left out. Requires the falseblood.setage permission.
* /fb getage [player] - gets a vampires age or yours if player is left out. Requires the falseblood.getage permission.

== Known Issues: ==

* toggling vampire mode while in creative mode or god mode is glitchy
* clearing inventory of a vampire using a different plugin will prevent vampire from switching between combat and feeding mode (can be fixed by killing vampire)
