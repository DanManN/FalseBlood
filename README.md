The purpose of this plugin is to simulate the feel of the TV series "TrueBlood" in minecraft. As of know this plugin adds vampires and the trueblood potion (Acrid Potion in game) to minecraft. //Eventually//, all the creatures - vampire, werewolf, werepanther, shifter, and fairy - will be implemented one at a time. Also, if you have any ideas of how to make this plugin better or how what abilities each creature should have then please post your suggestions below.

Becoming A Vampire:

1. Have your blood (food bar) drained by a vampire and refilled with vampire blood.
2. Go to "The End" with a clock, speed, regeneration, and strength potion of the same tier. Right-click on the clock.
3. Use the /fb make command to toggle vampire status.

Un-becoming a Vampire:

1. Dieing instantly from wooden-stake (aka wooden sword/shovel/hoe/pickaxe/ax, torch/redstone-torch, fence, or stick)
2. Use the /fb make command to toggle vampire status.
