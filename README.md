The purpose of this plugin is to simulate the feel of the TV series "TrueBlood" in minecraft. As of know this plugin adds vampires and the trueblood potion (Acrid Potion in game) to minecraft. Eventually, all the creatures - vampire, werewolf, werepanther, shifter, and fairy - will be implemented one at a time. Also, if you have any ideas of how to make this plugin better or how what abilities each creature should have then please post your suggestions below.

__Becoming A Vampire__

Have your blood (food bar) drained by a vampire and refilled with vampire blood.
Go to "The End" with a clock, speed, regeneration, and strength potion of the same tier. Right-click on the clock.
Use the /fb make command to toggle vampire status.
Un-becoming a Vampire:

Dying instantly from wooden-stake (aka wooden sword/shovel/hoe/pickaxe/ax, torch/redstone-torch, fence, or stick)
Use the /fb make command to toggle vampire status.
Advantage/DisAdvantages to Vampires:

are ignored by all aggressive mobs except silver fish, Nether mobs, and Bosses
automatically heal (at cost of blood)
can run faster (at cost of blood)
are stronger in combat (at cost of blood)
suck blood using fist from... (no 1 blood levels is shown as half a drumstick on the food bar)
players (4 levels per hit)
villagers (3 levels per hit but 10% food poison chance)
enderman (5 levels per hit but 20% food poison chance)
zombie (1 level per hit and 70% food poison chance)
can drink a bottle of false blood regenerating 4 blood levels (see recipe below)

can FLY at age 50! (at a cost of blood)

__Disadvantages__

burn in daylight (including nausea and blindness depending on intensity)

cannot pick up gold items (except a clock which is always in their inventory)
burn when touching gold either by hitting it with their first or standing on it
take damage when attacking a person in gold armor
take extra damaged when attacked by gold items. also gives them a weakness effect
have a 94% chance to die instantly from a wooden stake. Wearing armor decreases the chance depending on how full your set of armor is. with a full set of armor you have only a 6% chance of dieing instantly
can't eat normal food or drink normal potions.

__How to use abilities__

_Super Speed_

While sprinting, you will automatically be faster. Every five years a vampire ages increases the its speed.

_Super Strength_

Right click with your clock to switch to "kick ass" mode and you will be stronger in combat.

_Blood Sucking_

Right click with your clock to switch to "release your fangs" and then attack your pray .

_Brewing FalseBlood_

Fill a cauldron with water. Place a hopper directly on top of the cauldron and put some ender-eyes in the dropper. Right click the cauldron with a glass bottle to fill it up with FalseBlood.

_Give Blood_

Right Click a player with you fists to give them your blood which will either heal them or give them strength potion if they are at full health.

_Flying_

If you are over age 50 then simply toggle flight the same way you would in creative mode.

__Commands__
/fb make [player] - toggles the player's vampire status or yours if player is left out. Requires the falseblood.make permission.
/fb setage [player] [age] - sets a vampires age or yours if player is left out. Requires the falseblood.setage permission.
/fb getage [player] - gets a vampires age or yours if player is left out. Requires the falseblood.getage permission.
Known Issues:
toggling vampire mode while in creative mode or god mode is glitchy
clearing inventory of a vampire using a different plugin will prevent vampire from switching between combat and feeding mode (can be fixed by killing vampire or giving him a new clock)
