The purpose of this plugin is to simulate the feel of the TV series "TrueBlood" in minecraft. As of know this plugin adds vampires and the trueblood potion to minecraft. Eventually, all the creatures - vampire, werewolf, werepanther, shifter, and fairy - will be implemented one at a time. Also, if you have any ideas of how to make this plugin better or how what abilities each creature should have then please post your suggestions below.

Becoming A Vampire:

There are three methods to become a vampire.

1. Have your blood (food bar) drained by a vampire and refilled with vampire blood.

2. Go to "The End" with a clock and right-click with the clock in main hand. Also, add 10 years each for having at least one of the following items...
 * Nether Star
 * Dragon Egg
 * Elytra Wings
 * Note: These items will be removed if you have them in your inventory during the vampire transformation.

3. Use the '/fb make' command to toggle vampire status.

Un-becoming a Vampire:

1. Dying instantly from wooden-stake which includes:
 * wooden sword/shovel/hoe/pickaxe/axe
 * torch/redstone-torch
 * any fence/fence-gate
 * stick
 * fishing rod
 * carrot on a stick
 * sign
 * armor stand
 * banners
 
2. Use the /fb make command to toggle vampire status.

Advantage/DisAdvantages to Vampires:

Advantages:

* have night-vision effect constantly
* have water-breathing effect constantly
* are ignored by all aggressive mobs except silver fish, witches, Nether mobs, and Bosses
* automatically heal (at cost of blood) (improves with age)
* can run faster (at cost of blood) (improves with age)
* are stronger in combat (at cost of blood) (improves with age)
* suck blood using fist from...
  1. players (2 bars per hit) (6 saturation)
  2. villagers/witches (1.5 bars per hit) (5 saturation) (10% food poison chance)
  3. enderman (2.5 bars per hit) (7 saturation) (20% food poison chance)
  4. zombie/pig-zombie (0.5 bars per hit and 70% food poison chance)
* can drink a bottle of False Blood regenerating 2 blood bars and 4 saturation (see recipe below) (if a non-vampire drinks False Blood they will get nauseous)
* can heal players and give them strength potion if the player is at full health (at a cost of blood)
* can FLY at age 50! (at a cost of blood) (improves with age)

Disadvantages:

* burn in daylight (plus nausea when at full intensity)
* are vulnerable to gold which means that
* cannot pick up gold items (except a clock which is always in their inventory)
* burn when touching gold either by hitting it with their first or standing on it
* take damage when attacking a person in gold armor
* take extra damaged when attacked by gold items. also gives them a weakness effect
* have an 84% chance to die instantly from a wooden stake. Wearing armor decreases the chance depending on how full your set of armor is and the durability of the armor. Only a full set of undamaged armor will guarantee that you won't die instantly.
* can't eat normal food or drink normal potions.

How to use abilities

Super Speed:

While sprinting, you will automatically be faster. Every five years a vampire's age increases, sprint speed is boosted by another level.

Super Strength:

Right click with your clock to switch to "kick ass" mode and you will be stronger in combat.

Blood Sucking:

Right click with your clock to switch to "release your fangs" and then attack your pray .

Brewing False Blood:

Fill a cauldron with water. Place a hopper directly on top of the cauldron and put some beet-root in the hopper. Right click the cauldron with a glass bottle to fill it up with False Blood.

Give Blood:

Right Click a player with you fists to give them your blood which will either heal them or give them strength potion if they are at full health.

Flying:

If you are over age 50 then simply toggle flight the same way you would in creative mode.

Commands:
/fb make [player] - toggles the player's vampire status or yours if player is left out. Requires the falseblood.make permission.
/fb setage [player] [age] - sets a vampires age or yours if player is left out. Requires the falseblood.setage permission.
/fb getage [player] - gets a vampires age or yours if player is left out. Requires the falseblood.getage permission.

Known Issues:
clearing inventory of a vampire using a different plugin will remove their clock, preventing the vampire from switching between combat and feeding mode (can be fixed by killing vampire or giving him a new clock)
